#+TITLE: My Cool Typst
#+AUTHOR: Me You
#+EMAIL: test@test.de

#+BIBLIOGRAPHY: ./test.bib
#+print_bibliography: :title "Custom Ttitle For The Bibliography"
#+CITE_EXPORT: typst apa

#+INCLUDE: "./modus-theme/theme.typ" export typst

#+TYPST: #set page(paper: "a4")

#+BEGIN_EXPORT typst
#set page(paper: "a4")
#+END_EXPORT

* #1 Heading

I wonder if this is correct #1. We have to ensure that the character #" is
escaped correctly. Currently the character is escaped using the Unicode
escape. If we do not escape the character, then one could write raw Typst
statements. The resulting code would not compile properly.

* Code

Here is how we define present code.

#+CAPTION: Example Bash code.
#+NAME: mycode
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # print hi to console
  echo "hi"
#+END_SRC

** Inline

So this should be inline now src_sh{echo "inline"}. Lets see if that
works. Or maybe take a look at [[mycode]].

* List

** Plain
- One
- Two
  - TwoPointOne
  - TwoPointTwo
- Three

** Enumerated
1. One
2. Two
   1. TwoPointOne
   2. TwoPointTwo
3. Three

** Checkbox
- [ ] One
- [X] Two
- [-] Other
  - [ ] OtherOne
  - [X] OtherTwo

** Description

- Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
- Sean Astin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember him very well
  from his role as Mikey Walsh in /The Goonies/.

* Clock

Here we have an example task with time information. Lets see how this is
represented in Typst.

*** DONE [#A] Some task                                             :other: 
CLOSED: [2020-12-07 Mo 02:26]
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-12-07 Mo 02:26]
:LOGBOOK:
CLOCK: [2020-09-03 Do 13:03]--[2020-09-03 Do 13:47] =>  0:44
CLOCK: [2020-01-16 Do 10:44]--[2020-01-16 Do 16:26] =>  5:42
:END:

* Table

** First
#+CAPTION: hey caption
| A | B | C | D |  E |
|---+---+---+---+----|
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |  5 |
| 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |

** Second

=The following table contains verbatim content=

#+CAPTION: special table
| #A | =Verbatim= |
|----+------------|
|  1 |          2 |
|  6 |          7 |

* Fixed Width
: This text section uses a ficed-width font.

* Math

Here is a LaTeX snippets from the manual. However, these are not exported. It is
currently not possible for us to translate these elements into Typst code. Mabye
use on of the following projects for that:

- https://github.com/msakuta/latypst :: Translate LaTeX snippets to roughly equivalent Typst snippets
- https://github.com/mitex-rs/mitex :: Emulate LaTeX inside Typst

** Example

\begin{equation}                        % arbitrary environments,
x=\sqrt{b}                              % even tables, figures, etc
\end{equation}


This is inline Math: $a^2=b$. The following two statements are not inlined.

\( a + b \) \[ a=-2 \]

** Alternative

Currently Typst Math is not recoginized. It is possible to write Typst math directly in Org.

$ 1 * 1 $

To be safe that this behavior does not break in the future, one should use an export block.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT typst
$ 1 * 1 $
#+END_EXPORT

Escaping the dollar symbol is also recommended:

And here is some \$ dollar symbol.


* Labels

** Footnote
- Lets reference our definition [fn:A]
- COOL INLINE [fn:: This is the inline definition of this footnote]
- COOL ELSE [fn:ANYTHING: a definition]
- COOL TEST [fn:ANYTHING: a definition with #1]

*** Definitions
[fn:A] Let =A= be defined here.

** Cite
Here is my cite [cite:@DUMMY:1]. But here is another cite with a
different style [cite/ieee:@OTHER].

** <<<Radio Target>>>

Go to Radio Target for more information.

And this should be a target element <<ABC>>.

[[ABC][Should link to ABC now]].

** Link

Maybe found here [[http://google.com][Google]] :)
